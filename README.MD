This is a simplified version of BlueStacks 5 x64. (which runs Android 9 Pie) To install it correctly, run the Install.bat file as an administrator.

If you need to uninstall BlueStacks, you can't use the normal uninstaller from the control panel because there's a block on the access to the "C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\Engine\Pie64\Promotions" folder. Instead, use the uninstaller located at "C:\Program Files\BlueStacks_nxt\bsuninstaller.exe".

I've made s a video tutorial too
